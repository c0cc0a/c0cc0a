# WORK IN PROGRESS

## whoami
Andrea from Verona, Italy. 
I am 32 yo and I have an academic background in foreign languages (Chinese) and actually lived in China for three years.<br>
Later in my career i discovered a passion for another type of language, that of computers.<br>
I actually am an old time nerd and I always liked tinkering with computer stuff, but this time I want to take it to a whole new level.<br>
I want to become a penetration tester, I already got my first cert: **eJPT** from [eLearnSecurity](https://elearnsecurity.com/ "eLearnSecurity's Homepage")
and I am currently working towards getting my second cert: **eWPT**.<br>

## What i like:
	With regard to coding, I started out with shell scripting (bash) and now I am mostly focused on Python and C++, 
	but I am also keep practicing Bash on the side as well as Powershell. 
	I am also studying HTML, Javascript and PHP.

## What you'll find:
	At the moment the purpose of my Github is to create repos with exercises from the books that I am studying, for my future reference 
	and also hoping maybe to help someone that is studying the same books and is stuck on some exercise.

## How to reach me:
	My mail is: coccoa@pm.me
