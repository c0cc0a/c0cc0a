Andrea from Verona, Italy. 
I am studying to become a penetration tester, I already got my first cert: **eJPT** from [eLearnSecurity](https://elearnsecurity.com/ "eLearnSecurity's Homepage")
and I am currently working towards getting my second cert: **eWPT**.<br>

## What i like:
With regard to coding, I started out with shell scripting (bash) and now I am mostly focused on Python and C++, 	
but I am also keep practicing Bash as well as Powershell. 
I am also studying HTML, Javascript and PHP.

## My Github:
At the moment, the purpose of my Github is to create repos with exercises from the books that I am studying for my future reference, 
and also hoping maybe to help someone that is studying the same books and is stuck on some exercise.
